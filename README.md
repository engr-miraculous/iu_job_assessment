# üìç Location-Based Reporting App (Flutter)

This is a take-home technical assessment for the Flutter Developer position at **Iconic University**. The app allows users to log in and submit reports with a category, location (map or address input), and media (image or video). Previous reports are viewable in a list.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Platform Support & Permissions

- **Tested on Android only:** The project was only tested on Android, but it should work on iOS with minimal configuration since no platform-specific code or library was used.
- **Location Permissions:** The app will prompt for location permission the first time it is needed. If location services are turned off on the device, location and coordinates-related features may not work as expected, so in addition to granting permission, you will need to enable location services on the device.
- **Google Maps API Key Required:** The project requires a Google Maps API key. The current key in the repository may be revoked at any time. Please obtain your own API key and update it in both the manifest file and the location service as shown below:
  - In `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
    ```xml
    <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY" android:value="<KEY>"/>
    ```
  - In [location_service.dart](lib/services/location_service.dart):
    ```dart
    const LocationService._internal();
    static const String _googlePlacesApiKey = '<KEY>';
    static const String _placesBaseUrl = 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place';
    ```
- **Drift/Database Analyzer Errors:** If you see errors in your IDE from [database_service.dart](lib/services/database_service.dart), you can ignore them, the app will still compile and run correctly if you ignore the IDE warning. Drift generates some code automatically, which may not be immediately available or detected by the Flutter analyzer, causing these errors.
- **Mock Reports:** The app generates mock reports by default to pre-populate the report list. If you only want to see the reports you enter, set the value of `_totalMockReports` in [report_service.dart](lib/services/report_service.dart) to `0` and no pre-generated reports will appear.
